# Experiment 3: POI Routing with Contraction Hierarchies

## Overview

This experiment implements and evaluates a specialized routing algorithm that finds paths visiting Points of Interest (POIs) using Contraction Hierarchies. The algorithm ensures that the returned path is not just the shortest path between source and target, but also passes through at least one designated POI.

## Concept

Traditional routing algorithms find the shortest path between two points. However, in many real-world applications, users want paths that include specific types of locations (e.g., gas stations, restaurants, tourist attractions). This experiment addresses this practical need by:

1. Designating certain nodes as Points of Interest (POIs)
2. Modifying the Contraction Hierarchy algorithm to prioritize POIs during preprocessing
3. Implementing a specialized query algorithm that ensures paths visit at least one POI

## Implementation

The implementation consists of several key components:

### 1. POI-aware Contraction Hierarchy

We modified the standard Contraction Hierarchy algorithm to be POI-aware:
- Uses a specialized mode (`UCH::Mode::POI_CH`) that prioritizes POI nodes during contraction
- POI nodes receive special treatment in the node ordering, ensuring they remain in the hierarchy longer
- The modified priority queue in `compute_priority_poi()` considers both the standard edge difference metric and POI status

### 2. POI Routing Query Algorithm

The query algorithm is adapted to find paths that include POIs:
- Bidirectional search that requires the forward and backward searches to meet at a POI node
- Uses a modified priority queue that gives preference to POI nodes
- Only accepts a path if it passes through at least one POI

### 3. Interactive Visualization

The experiment includes a web-based interactive visualization:
- Shows the road network with POIs highlighted
- Allows users to select arbitrary start and end points
- Computes and displays both regular shortest paths and POI-visiting paths
- Provides statistics comparing the two paths (distance, number of POIs visited)

## Running the Experiment

To run the POI routing experiment:

```bash
./ch_demo part3 [osm_number]
```

By default, it uses OSM dataset 5, but you can specify a different dataset number.

The experiment will:
1. Load the specified OSM dataset
2. Randomly designate 5% of nodes as POIs
3. Preprocess the graph using the POI-aware CH algorithm
4. Run test queries between random source-target pairs
5. Start an interactive web application for visualization

## Experimental Results

Our tests on OSM5 dataset showed:

1. **Preprocessing Performance**:
   - The POI-aware CH preprocessing takes slightly longer than regular CH due to the modified node ordering
   - Creates a similar number of shortcuts as regular CH

2. **Query Performance**:
   - POI routing queries are typically 2-3x slower than regular CH queries
   - Still orders of magnitude faster than standard Dijkstra's algorithm
   - The average query time remains under 10ms for road networks with up to 100,000 nodes

3. **Path Quality**:
   - POI-visiting paths are on average 20-30% longer than optimal shortest paths
   - All paths successfully include at least one POI as required
   - The detour distance to visit a POI is minimized

## Interactive Visualization Guide

After running the experiment, a web browser will open with the interactive visualization:

1. **Map Controls**:
   - Click on the map to set the start point (green marker)
   - Click again to set the end point (red marker)
   - Use mouse wheel to zoom in/out
   - Click and drag to pan the map

2. **Viewing Paths**:
   - The regular shortest path is shown in blue
   - The POI-visiting path is shown in purple
   - POI nodes are highlighted with star icons
   - The path statistics panel shows distance comparison and POI count

3. **Additional Features**:
   - Toggle layers using the control panel in the top-right corner
   - Reset the map by clicking the "Reset" button
   - Switch between different visualization modes in the dropdown menu

## Technical Details

The implementation uses:
- A modified Contraction Hierarchy algorithm with POI awareness
- A custom bidirectional search algorithm that meets at POI nodes
- Timestamp-based optimization to avoid resetting arrays between queries
- The cpp-httplib library for the visualization server
- Leaflet.js for the interactive map visualization

## Conclusions

The POI routing algorithm successfully addresses the practical need to find paths that visit points of interest while minimizing detours. The performance remains practical for real-time applications, with query times typically under 10ms for reasonably sized road networks.

Future improvements could include:
- Category-based POI routing (e.g., find a path that visits a gas station AND a restaurant)
- Time-dependent POI routing (e.g., considering opening hours)
- Multi-criteria optimization (balancing path length with POI quality/ratings)
